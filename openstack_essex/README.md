Install OpenStack Essex
=======================

This playbook can install [OpenStack Essex on a Ubuntu 12.04 image](http://www.hastexo.com/resources/docs/installing-openstack-essex-20121-ubuntu-1204-precise-pangolin).

Much of what is here is based of [Lorin's work](https://github.com/lorin/openstack-ansible) and [Hastexo's blog post on Essex](http://www.hastexo.com/resources/docs/installing-openstack-essex-20121-ubuntu-1204-precise-pangolin).

NOTE:
- this playbook is pretty dissorganized as I am still working my way through getting a grasp on Ansible and OpenStack best practices.
- and this was done before Ansible had roles and such which leads to a much nicer file layout, if we go to a later version of openstack I will update with roles


Thanks!
